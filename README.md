This crate provides a command line tool for generating schema migrations based on edits to a canonical schema file.

## Status

This crate is in an early stage of development and may not work with your schema or have unexpected behaviourâ€”always double check the output.

## Usage

```sh
# install the cli
cargo install sql-schema

# generate a schema file from existing migrations
sql-schema schema \
    --schema-path ./schema/schema.sql \ # this is the default value
    --migrations-dir ./schema/migrations # this is the default value
# -> writing ./schema/schema.sql

# generate a migration after editing the schema file
sql-schema migration --name my_new_migration \
    --include-down true \ # default is true if any down migration exists
    --schema-path ./schema/schema.sql \ # this is the default value
    --migrations-dir ./schema/migrations # this is the default value
# -> writing schema/migrations/1739486729_my_new_migration.up.sql
# -> writing schema/migrations/1739486729_my_new_migration.down.sql
```

## Goals

- Time saver: You can generate an up _and_ down migration for the cost of editing a schema.
- Non restrictive: You can edit the generated migrations as needed (e.g. if you need to migrate data along side a schema change).
- Minimal buy-in: You don't have to change anything about your project to start or stop using it (committing the generated schema is optional).
- Works with any SQL dialect.
